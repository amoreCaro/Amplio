Theoretical principles behind risk and energy reduction in relation to data centre M&E and IT services are covered; on-site measurements made; and opportunities for savings explored. Each programme is interactive and bespoke to the client’s facility and objectives and culminates in a presentation to management of the participants’ findings and recommendations. ",

In each case the outcome has been an action plan with improvement recommendations, even at sites where best practice has already been implemented. To date our programme has enabled an average energy reduction of 12%, with an ROI of just 8 months. In addition to the financial, energy and risk incentives, the programme also provides staff with deeper technical knowledge and aids cross-disciplinary communication.",

It covers the sources of energy consumption across electrical, mechanical, and IT systems, along with an introduction to Net Zero Carbon and Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. The training also explains how improving energy efficiency can support the transition to net zero carbon, and provides key theories for optimizing energy consumption, including air management, air segregation, and fan laws/refrigeration cycles. Additionally, it encourages consideration of electricity sources as opportunities to reduce carbon emissions and includes low-cost practical measures to improve energy performance. Finally, participants learn how to formulate action plans to deliver energy savings."
