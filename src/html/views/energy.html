          "Our Energy Assessments, including ESOS (Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme), provide a comprehensive consultancy approach focused on reducing energy consumption and risk without the added learning component. A typical energy assessment involves a thorough site visit, review of facility drawings and documentation, and an in-depth analysis of mechanical and electrical systems. We examine energy consumption across mechanical, electrical, and IT equipment, along with temperature measurements and current data hall air performance management, including air bypass, recirculation, and segregation.",
          "The assessment benchmarks best practices, reviews operational settings, and explores opportunities for system upgrades to improve efficiency and reduce costs. We also provide access to air management tools for ongoing assessments. Additionally, we evaluate the company's eligibility under ESOS, considering compliance with ISO 50001 certification, total energy consumption (including fuels, heat, renewables, electricity, and transport fuel), and identifying a lead assessor. Upon completion, we ensure compliance is notified to the Environment Agency and highlight areas for significant energy reduction."

Using carbon as a basis for comparison, these models can then be used to review each option and form a basis for impact reduction recommendations.",
